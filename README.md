```python blockchain.py -p 5000```
2. You can add a new node to blockchain by executing the same command and specifying a port that is not already used. For example, ```python blockchain.py -p 5001```
3. TO start the blockchain client, go to ```blockchain_client``` folder and execute the command below:
```python blockchain_client.py -p 8080```
4. You can access the blockchain frontend and blockchain client dashboards from your browser by going to localhost:5000 and localhost:8080
